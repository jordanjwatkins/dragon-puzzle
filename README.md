#Dragon Puzzle

**Drag and Drop (Dragon Drop) Puzzle**

I like to build small games to practice coding outside of work. 

[Solve the puzzle](http://jordanjwatkins.com/dragon-puzzle/) or try a [simpler version](http://jordanjwatkins.com/black-box/) (warning: simpler version still stumps some people).

I used what I learned coding this project on my later projects: [Mondrian Generator](http://jordanjwatkins.github.io/mondrian-generator/) and [Gridmancer](http://jordanjwatkins.github.io/gridmancer-2/).
